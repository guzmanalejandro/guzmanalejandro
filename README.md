## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the profile of Alejandro Guzman in GitHub.

I am currently studying artificial intelligence at the Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya as my main activity in my day to day, but I also develop others for academic or economic purposes. My main interests are data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and Big Data. Soon I will develop specific repositories in order to expand my knowledge in the field of research on the aforementioned topics.

In my profile you will find public repositories about personal projects that I have carried out during my university studies, at work or for simple research. Some sections of the repositories are highlighted because, personally, I find them very interesting in relation to the topics they deal with. Which is not to say that the rest of the repository isn't just as useful.

Currently I a working as an AI Engineer at FundaciÃ³ Bosch i Gimpera, but I also worked as a Data Scientist, Software Engineer and IT Engineer.

The sections of the repositories are organized as clearly as possible, but if you have any questions, don't hesitate to [contact me](alejandroguzman.dg@gmail.com), I will answer you within a maximum period of 48 working hours.

On the other hand, If you want to know more about me, I invite you to take a look at my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-guzman-requena-822b611b8/). I plan in the near future to develop a personal web page where I can publish all the work I do on a regular basis. The website release date will be sometime in 2023 if all goes smoothly.

Thank you very much for your attention and I hope that the repositories you find in my profile are useful for what you are looking for.
