- ðŸ‘‹ Hello to everyone and welcome to the profile of Alejandro Guzman in GitHub.

I am currently studying computer engineering at the University of Barcelona as my main activity in my day to day, but I also develop others for academic or economic purposes.

In my profile you will find public repositories about personal projects that I have carried out during my university studies, at work or for simple research.

The sections of the repositories are organized as clearly as possible, but if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me, I will answer you within a maximum period of 48 working hours.
