ðŸ‘‹ Hello to everyone and welcome to the profile of Alejandro Guzman in GitHub.

I am currently studying computer engineering at the University of Barcelona as my main activity in my day to day, but I also develop others for academic or economic purposes. My main interests are data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and Big Data. Soon I will develop specific repositories in order to expand my knowledge in the field of research on the aforementioned topics.

In my profile you will find public repositories about personal projects that I have carried out during my university studies, at work or for simple research. Some sections of the repositories are highlighted because, personally, I find them very interesting in relation to the topics they deal with. Which is not to say that the rest of the repository isn't just as useful.

Currently I am also doing an internship at AkzoNobel in the Information Technology Management section, maintaining and organizing a user database, developing algorithms in Python for the same purpose. The algorithms can be found in a public repository dedicated to it.

The sections of the repositories are organized as clearly as possible, but if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me, I will answer you within a maximum period of 48 working hours.
